# Info
This is a basic console app that serves as a FileUploader from local machines. It locates the file to be uploaded and sends it to IoT Central file storage.

If you would like to run this, change the values in `Program.cs` as follows:
````csharp
string scopeId = "<sopeId from IoTCental>";
string deviceId = "<deviceId from IoTCental>";
string deviceKey = "<deviceId from IoTCental>"; 
string modelId = "<modelId from IoTCental>"; 
````
You can obtain these IDs and keys from IoT Central when you create an application.
