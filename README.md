# Info
This repository contains four directories that can be used to implement the end-to-end solution.
- **[IoTCentral-FileUploader](https://github.com/ryanninodizon/EHR-PoC/tree/main/IoTCentral-FileUploader  "IoTCentral-FileUploader") -** This is a basic console app that serves as a FileUploader from local machines. It locates the file to be uploaded and sends it to IoT Central file storage.

- **[spa](https://github.com/ryanninodizon/EHR-PoC/tree/main/spa "spa") -** An Angular project that showcases the authentication/authorization with Microsoft Identity Platform.
